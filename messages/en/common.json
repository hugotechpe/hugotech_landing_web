We work together on: clarifying your next step (first job, promotion, transition), developing skills that AI can't replace (leadership, strategic communication), overcoming impostor syndrome, avoiding burnout and building a sustainable career with purpose. I don't just give advice, I help you discover your strengths and make decisions aligned with your values."

We work on: identifying the 7 signs of burnout before it's too late, creating healthy digital boundaries (Slack, email, meetings), designing your 30-day anti-burnout plan, protecting your recharge time without guilt, and deciding if your exhaustion is recoverable or if you need to change environments. My approach is preventive: building a tech career where success doesn't drain you from the inside."

If you decide to continue, follow-up sessions work by voluntary donation (suggested: S/35 soles, ~$10 USD). 100% of what's collected is donated to social causes in Peru: animal shelters, tech scholarships for young people and community kitchens. <link>See social causes</link>.

      "por-que-senior-necesita-mentor": {
        "question": "Why does a Senior Developer need a technical mentor?",
        "answer": "A Senior Developer needs a technical mentor because professional growth doesn't end when you reach Senior level. The challenges change: it's no longer just about writing code, but leading architectures, mentoring juniors, communicating technical decisions to stakeholders, and navigating organizational politics. A technical mentor helps you see your blind spots, make strategic career decisions (Staff Engineer or Engineering Manager?), develop leadership skills without losing technical essence, and avoid the stagnation that affects 67% of seniors after 3 years in the same role."
      },
      "como-ayuda-mentor-burnout": {
        "question": "How does a tech mentor help prevent developer burnout?",
        "answer": "A tech mentor helps prevent burnout by identifying early signs like chronic fatigue, cynicism towards work, and loss of productivity. They teach you to establish healthy boundaries between work and personal life, communicate your workload assertively, recognize when a project or culture is toxic, and develop sustainable self-care strategies. Additionally, they help you reconnect with your professional purpose when you feel your work has no impact. Tech burnout isn't solved just with vacation: it's prevented with mindset, boundaries, and a mentor who understands industry pressure because they lived it."
      },
      "diferencia-mentor-coach-tech": {
        "question": "What's the difference between a technical mentor and an executive coach?",
        "answer": "A technical mentor has direct experience in technology (development, architecture, leading tech teams) and shares industry-specific knowledge. They guide you with real examples from their career, connect you with their professional network, and give you validated shortcuts to grow in tech. An executive coach focuses on general soft skills (leadership, communication, time management) without necessarily understanding the specific technical challenges of a developer: impostor syndrome in code reviews, anxiety about being technologically outdated, or how to lead distributed remote teams. A technical mentor combines both worlds: technical expertise + human development."
      },
      "habilidades-ia-no-reemplaza": {
        "question": "What human skills can AI not replace in developers?",
        "answer": "AI can generate code, but it cannot replace critical human skills in developers: empathetic communication with stakeholders to understand real needs beyond what they say, technical leadership that inspires and motivates distributed teams, architectural decision-making considering political and business factors, conflict management in code reviews without damaging relationships, creativity to solve ambiguous problems without clear specifications, mentorship that transforms juniors into seniors sustainably, and trust-building in teams that enables innovation without fear of failure. In 2025, the most valuable developers are those who combine technical expertise with emotional intelligence, systems thinking, and the ability to influence without formal authority."
      },
      "sintomas-estancamiento-senior": {
        "question": "What are the symptoms of stagnation in a Senior Developer?",
        "answer": "Symptoms of stagnation in a Senior Developer include: doing the same type of tasks repetitively without learning anything new, feeling your work is 'more of the same' without technical challenges, not receiving constructive feedback or promotions for more than 2 years, avoiding learning new technologies due to lack of motivation, intensified impostor syndrome ('I never know enough'), loss of passion for technology that used to excite you, and constantly questioning whether you should change companies, tech stack, or even careers. Stagnation isn't lack of talent: it's lack of clear direction and challenges that stretch you professionally."
      },
      "cuando-buscar-mentor-tech": {
        "question": "When is the right time to seek a technical mentor?",
        "answer": "The right time to seek a technical mentor is when you feel your growth has stalled, when you're in a career transition (from developer to tech lead, from backend to fullstack, from IC to management), when suffering from burnout or paralyzing impostor syndrome, when you rejected or accepted a job offer and now have doubts, when your company lacks seniors to learn from, or when you want to jump to Senior/Staff but don't know how. It's also critical to seek mentorship before making important decisions: changing companies, negotiating salary, choosing between two offers, or deciding whether to specialize or remain a generalist. A mentor saves you years of costly mistakes."
      },
      "que-esperar-primera-sesion-mentor": {
        "question": "What can I expect from my first session with a technical mentor?",
        "answer": "In your first session with a technical mentor you can expect an honest 45-60 minute conversation where we explore your current situation (career, challenges, goals), identify your strengths and blind spots you don't see alone, define your immediate objective (next 3-6 months), and design an initial action plan with concrete steps. It's not empty motivational talk: it's real diagnosis + applicable strategy. A good mentor asks uncomfortable questions that force you to reflect, gives you perspectives you hadn't considered, and challenges you to leave your comfort zone. If by the end you don't feel clarity or connection, that mentor isn't for you. The first session should leave you with renewed energy and clear direction."
      },
      "como-prepararse-para-tech-lead": {
        "question": "How can a mentor help me prepare to be a Tech Lead?",
        "answer": "A mentor helps you prepare to be a Tech Lead by developing skills you don't learn from programming: delegating without micromanaging, giving technical feedback without destroying team trust, negotiating realistic deadlines with product managers, communicating architectural decisions to non-technical stakeholders, effectively mentoring junior developers, handling difficult conversations (underperformance, conflicts), and balancing time between code and leadership. They share real experiences from their transition to Tech Lead, help you identify if leadership is your path or if you prefer the Staff/Principal Engineer route, and prepare you for the first 90 days in the role where 40% of new Tech Leads fail due to lack of clarity in their new professional identity."
      },
      "mentor-para-primer-empleo-tech": {
        "question": "Can a mentor help me get my first tech job?",
        "answer": "Yes, a tech mentor can accelerate your process to get your first job by teaching you to build a portfolio that demonstrates real skills (not just copied tutorials), prepare for technical interviews with algorithm and system design problems, develop communication skills to explain your code clearly, understand what recruiters look for in a junior (learning attitude, collaboration, autonomy), and connect you with their professional network for referrals (70% of tech jobs come from networking, not cold applications). They also help you manage emotional rejection from failed interviews, identify red flags in job offers, and negotiate your first salary without selling yourself cheap out of desperation."
      },
      "mentor-remoto-vs-presencial": {
        "question": "Is 100% remote technical mentoring effective?",
        "answer": "Yes, 100% remote technical mentoring is equally effective (sometimes more) than in-person because current tools (Zoom, Google Meet, VS Code Live Share, Miro, Notion) enable high-quality sessions with screen sharing, virtual pair programming, and collaborative documentation. Remote advantages include: schedule flexibility (ideal for different time zones), session recording for later review, access to international mentors with experience in USA/Europe companies you wouldn't have locally, elimination of commute time, and greater comfort discussing vulnerable topics (impostor syndrome, burnout, insecurities) from your safe space. 85% of tech mentoring post-2020 is remote and shows satisfaction rates similar to or higher than in-person."

        "question": "How long does each session last?",
        "answer": "Each session lasts 45 minutes. It's enough time to delve into a specific topic, explore new perspectives and design concrete action steps. If you need more time, we can coordinate it."

        "question": "What is coaching from your perspective, Hugo?",
        "answer": "For me, coaching is a safe space where you allow yourself to be vulnerable. It's not someone telling you what to do, but someone who asks you the questions you avoid asking yourself. After <link href='/about'>10 years leading tech teams</link>, living through burnout, impostor syndrome, and difficult transitions, I learned that the biggest obstacle is not technical—it's the limiting beliefs we repeat to ourselves. Coaching is that conversation where you finally give yourself permission to think differently. It's not magic, nor quick fixes. It's a process of deep self-awareness that transforms how you see yourself, your career, and your decisions. My style combines the structure of a tech mentor (I've been where you are: sprints, code reviews, complex architectures) with the empathy of someone who understands that behind every senior developer is a human being with doubts, fears, and dreams.

      "que-es-mentor-coach": {
        "question": "What is a mentor coach?",
        "answer": "A mentor coach is a professional who combines two roles: MENTOR: Shares direct experience. 'I've been in your situation before, here's what I learned, here are the patterns I see.' Gives advice based on their career path, shows shortcuts, helps avoid mistakes they made. COACH: Doesn't impose answers, asks powerful questions so YOU discover your solutions. Works on mindset, limiting beliefs, self-awareness, decision-making. The difference from a traditional mentor: a mentor coach doesn't just say 'do this', but helps you think for yourself. For example: MENTOR: 'When I became Tech Lead, I implemented daily standups and structured 1-on-1s.' MENTOR COACH: 'What does being a Tech Lead mean to you? What leadership style aligns with your values? What's stopping you from being the leader you want to be?' It combines the wisdom of experience (mentor) with the transformative power of coaching questions (coach). I'm a mentor coach because I share my 10 years in tech, but I don't impose my path on you: I help you design yours. Learn about <link href='/metodo-hugotech'>my working methodology here</link>."

        "question": "What is a tech mentor coach?",
        "answer": "A tech mentor coach is a mentor coach specialized in technology professionals (developers, QA, tech leads, product managers). The key: understands your reality because they lived it—endless sprints, impostor syndrome when reviewing code from others, pressure to stay updated with frameworks, anxiety of oncall, frustration of technical debt, loneliness of remote work, difficult decisions between technical growth and management. It's not generic executive coaching that doesn't understand your jargon. A tech mentor coach speaks your language: understands what a sprint retrospective is, why microservices complicate your life, what it means to migrate a monolith, what you feel when your PR is destroyed in code review, the dilemma of staying Senior IC or becoming Engineering Manager. Combines technical mentoring (career, architecture, technical decisions) with coaching on human skills (communication, leadership, confidence, work-life balance, purpose). I'm a mentor coach tech because I built products from scratch, led distributed teams, made bad technical decisions, lived burnout, overcame impostor syndrome. I don't advise from theory: I accompany you from lived experience. Read <link href='/testimonials'>real transformation stories</link> from other tech professionals."

      "que-es-coaching-tech": {
        "question": "What is tech coaching?",
        "answer": "Tech coaching is professional coaching applied to technology sector professionals. It's NOT teaching you to program, nor technical mentoring on architecture. It's working on the human and strategic part of your tech career: developing soft skills (communication, influence, difficult conversations), overcoming impostor syndrome ('I'm not good enough to be senior'), preventing and managing burnout (sprints without end, always-on culture), facilitating transitions (IC to Manager, Backend to Fullstack, employee to freelance), improving your tech personal brand (LinkedIn, talks, visibility), negotiating salary and promotions based on impact, designing your medium and long-term career path, building confidence to lead technical initiatives and teams. The difference from generic coaching: a tech coach understands your context—your challenges are not the same as a sales executive or a lawyer. In tech you face unique pressure: constant obsolescence, meritocracy culture, remote work, cross-cultural teams, Stack Overflow as judge of your value.

        "answer": "Coaching serves to live consciously instead of reacting automatically. In everyday life, coaching helps you: CLARITY: Understand what you really want (not what others expect from you). Define your priorities, values, and purpose. DECISIONS: Make important choices from self-knowledge, not from fear, guilt, or external pressure. Career change? Ask for a raise? End a relationship? Coaching gives you tools to decide with confidence. RELATIONSHIPS: Improve how you communicate with your partner, family, bosses, coworkers. Set healthy boundaries without guilt. SELF-CONFIDENCE: Overcome impostor syndrome, self-sabotage, limiting beliefs ('I'm not good enough', 'I don't deserve success'). BALANCE: Find work-life balance, avoid burnout, learn to say no, prioritize your mental health. ACTION: Stop procrastinating, design concrete plans, maintain commitment to your goals, celebrate small progress. It's not therapy (doesn't resolve traumas), nor consultancy (doesn't tell you what to do). Coaching is that space where you stop, reflect, and design the life you want to live. Not the one you inherited or the one others chose for you. It's an investment in yourself that transforms everything.

        "answer": "The 4 fundamental pillars of coaching are: 1) TRUST - Foundation of the process. Without trust (sincerity, coach competence), there is no openness or vulnerability. The coachee must feel safe to share fears, doubts, failures. 2) AWARENESS - Deep self-knowledge. Coaching helps the coachee realize their thought patterns, limiting beliefs, hidden strengths, and blind spots that block their growth. 3) AUTHENTIC COMMUNICATION - Active listening and powerful questions. The coach doesn't advise, asks questions that challenge the coachee to think differently. Empathy without judgment. 4) ACTION/ACCOUNTABILITY - Design of concrete steps and coachee commitment to their process. Coaching is not reflective therapy: it generates real and measurable changes in professional and personal life."

        "answer": "The 3 C's of exceptional coaching are: 1) CURIOSITY - Foundation of a good coach. Genuine curiosity to understand the coachee beyond the superficial. Not assume, but ask. Not judge, but explore. The coach's curiosity generates deep reflection in the coachee. 2) COURAGE - Courage to ask the difficult questions no one else asks. Courage to confront with empathy the coachee's contradictions. Courage to hold uncomfortable silences that generate powerful insights. Courage to challenge the coachee to leave their comfort zone. 3) COMPASSION - Deep empathy without becoming a rescuer. Compassion to accompany the pain of the change process, but without taking away the coachee's responsibility for their transformation. Compassion to celebrate each small advance. A coach with the 3 C's transforms lives, not just careers."

        "answer": "The coaching process has 4 key stages: 1) REACTION/EXPLORATION - First phase where the coachee arrives with a problem, pain, confusion. Initial exploration of the current situation, identification of emotions, and building coach-coachee trust. 2) LEARNING/AWARENESS - Phase of deep self-knowledge. The coachee becomes aware of their limiting patterns, beliefs, hidden strengths. Paradigms are questioned. Here the greatest insights occur: 'I didn't know I thought that way'. 3) BEHAVIOR/EXPERIMENTATION - Design of new actions aligned with insights. The coachee experiments with new behaviors in their real life: new conversations, different decisions, healthy boundaries. What works and what doesn't is measured. 4) RESULTS/INTEGRATION - Consolidation of changes. The coachee integrates learnings as part of their new identity. Results are visible: promotion, better communication, work-life balance, confidence. Coaching ends when the coachee no longer needs the coach."

The coachee becomes aware of their thoughts, emotions, limiting beliefs, and behavior patterns that sabotage their success. Without awareness, there is no transformation. 2) SELF-BELIEF/ACCOUNTABILITY - The coachee assumes total responsibility for their life and decisions. Stops victimizing themselves, blaming others, or waiting for circumstances to change. Believes in their ability to create their own future. 3) ACTION/COMMITMENT - Coaching is not just reflective conversation: it generates concrete and measurable actions.

Their success is measured by YOUR growth, not business objectives. Confidential relationship, no corporate agenda. Challenges you without judging. Their goal is to expand your awareness and decision-making capacity. MANAGER: Has formal authority (can promote or fire you). Must meet business objectives (delivery, roadmap, KPIs). Their success depends on team performance. Gives directives when necessary. Evaluates your performance with metrics. Professional relationship with clear limits. A good manager can have coaching skills (empower, ask, develop), but their main role is management. A coach is never your boss: they're your mirror, your challenger, and your ally in your own growth."

        "question": "How much does a coaching session cost in Peru?",
        "answer": "The average cost of a coaching session in Peru (Lima, 2025) is: General Coaching (without certification): S/80-150 per 60 min session. ICF Certified Coaching: S/200-400 per session. Specialized Coaching (Executive, Tech, Leadership): S/300-600 per session. 4-6 session packages: S/800-2,000 with discount. Group Coaching/Workshops: S/50-120 per person. Corporate Coaching (B2B): S/1,500-3,500 per executive (3-6 month program). My model is different by conviction: 1-to-1 Tech Mentoring: 100% FREE, no strings attached. Coaching with Purpose: First session free. Following: S/35 going 100% to social causes (animal shelters, tech scholarships, community kitchens). My philosophy: Professional growth should not be limited by economic resources.

        "question": "How many years is a coaching career?",
        "answer": "There is no 'coaching university degree' in Peru. Coaching is learned through professional certifications: ACC Certification (Associate Certified Coach - ICF): 6-9 months (60 hrs training + practice). PCC Certification (Professional Certified Coach - ICF): 12-18 months (125 hrs training + 500 hrs supervised practice). MCC Certification (Master Certified Coach - ICF): 3-5 years (advanced experience + 200 hrs training + 2,500 hrs practice). University Coaching Diplomas: 6-12 months (ESAN, UPC, Pacifico). Ontological Training (Newfield, Axon): 9-12 months. REALITY: You can start paid coaching after 6-12 months of training, but mastery comes with years of practice, supervision, and continuous personal development. Many successful coaches come from previous careers (Psychology, HR, Engineering, Administration) and add coaching as a specialization, not as a first career."

      "items": [
        {
          "question": "Why Hugo Casanova and not another tech coach?",
          "answer": "Because Hugo LIVED 18 years in tech from 'doing': Backend Developer, Tech Lead, Country Manager. He reached visible success... and internal emptiness. His breaking point led him to ontological coaching (ICF training), where he discovered he DIDN'T need to 'do things better'. He needed to ReCode himself as BEING. That's how his Ontological ReCode® method was born: as engineer you recode buggy code, as leader you ReCode limiting beliefs, reactive emotionality, and toxic leadership patterns. He's the ONLY coach who unites senior engineering with Ontological ReCoding in Latin America."
        },
        {
          "question": "What exactly is Ontological ReCoding®?",
          "answer": "It's NOT 'improve your leadership skills'. It's NOT 'learn to communicate better'. Ontological coaching works on WHO YOU ARE when you lead, communicate, decide. Your OBSERVER: how you see yourself, your team, challenges. Your LANGUAGE: what you say creates your reality. Your EMOTIONALITY: you can't 'act calm' if inside you're anxious. ReCode® Method: as engineer you recode buggy code (if-else, loops, architecture). As leader, you ReCode your identity, your conversations, your emotional patterns. Same logic: identify bug (limiting belief), understand root cause (where it comes from), recode (transform observer), test (new results). It's ontological coaching with engineering thinking."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is it different from traditional executive coaching?",
          "answer": "Traditional coaching: 'What do you want to achieve?' → actions → habits. Ontological coaching: 'WHO are you BEING when you lead?' → observer transformation → identity shift → actions flow naturally. Example: Traditional coach: 'Learn to delegate (technique)'. Ontological ReCode®: 'Why do you need to control everything? What do you fear if you let go? Who would you BE if you trusted?' You don't learn to delegate. You BECOME someone who naturally trusts. Delegation is consequence, not objective. Plus: Hugo speaks your language (sprints, deploys, on-call, tech debt). He doesn't have to 'understand your context' because he lived it 18 years."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the ReCode® Fulldays and Camps format?",
          "answer": "ReCode® Fulldays: intensive 1-day immersions (8 hours) where we work deeply on ONE specific transformation: from control to trust, from impostor to leader, from burnout to sustainable energy. It's NOT theory. It's experiential ontological work with powerful questions, somatic practices, identity deconstruction. You leave with deep shift, not just 'notes'. ReCode® Camps: 2-3 day retreats (fri-sun) for teams or individual leaders seeking profound transformation. We combine ontological coaching, nature, vulnerability, real community. Participants describe it as 'before and after in my leadership'. Investment: fulldays from $500, camps from $1,500. First exploratory session always free."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it for me if I don't have a 'big problem'?",
          "answer": "Ontological ReCode® is NOT therapy (doesn't work on trauma). It's NOT consulting (doesn't give you solutions). It's accompaniment for leaders who: (1) Feel 'successful outside, empty inside'. (2) Want to lead from purpose, not obligation. (3) Seek sustainable high performance, not burnout. (4) Want authentic relationships, not masks. (5) Want to BE the leader they admire, not act like one. If you're 'fine but not fulfilled', if you sense 'there must be another way to lead', if you're tired of 'acting confident' when inside you doubt: ReCode® is for you. It's not about fixing problems. It's about expanding who you ARE."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long until I see results?",
          "answer": "FIRST SESSION: you leave with deep clarity (not 'aha' moments, but ontological shifts). 3 MONTHS (12 sessions): sustainable identity transformation. You stop 'trying to be better leader' and start BEING different leader naturally. 6 MONTHS: consolidated ReCode®. Your team, peers, family notice you're different (calmer, clearer, more present, more powerful). It's NOT 'learning techniques gradually'. Ontological coaching can generate immediate shifts ('I never saw it that way'). But consolidating new identity requires time, practice, accompaniment. First session is free: you'll know if ReCode® resonates with you. No pressure, no sales. Just authentic conversation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you work 1-on-1 or with teams?",
          "answer": "BOTH. (1) Individual Ontological Coaching: for CTOs, Tech Leads, Engineering Managers, Staff Engineers who need profound personal transformation. 1-hour sessions, biweekly, 3-6 month minimum. (2) Team ReCode® Programs: for 5-15 person teams needing culture, collaboration, leadership transformation. 12-week programs with group + individual sessions. (3) ReCode® Fulldays and Camps: intensive for individuals or teams seeking deep transformation in short time. First call is diagnostic: we see what format fits your real need."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you work with companies outside Peru?",
          "answer": "Yes, 100% remote. I serve clients throughout Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Chile) and United States. Sessions via Zoom/Google Meet, Spanish or English. Flexible schedule for your timezone. Ontological coaching has no borders: if your challenge is leadership, identity, purpose, I can accompany you wherever you are. ReCode® Fulldays and Camps can be in-person (Peru/your country) or remote intensive format."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does Ontological ReCode® investment cost?",
          "answer": "Individual Coaching: $150/session (1 hour). Recommended packages: 12 sessions (3 months) $1,500, 24 sessions (6 months) $2,800. ReCode® Fulldays: from $500 (individual), $3,000 (team 5-10 people). ReCode® Camps: from $1,500 (individual 2 days), $8,000 (team retreat 3 days). FIRST SESSION ALWAYS FREE (1 hour): no commitment, no sales. Just authentic conversation to see if ReCode® is for you. If you don't feel connection or clarity, no problem. Ontological coaching requires resonance, not convincing."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I'm not sure if ontological coaching is for me?",
          "answer": "Perfect. FIRST SESSION IS FREE (no commitment). We'll have authentic conversation: I ask powerful questions, you explore your current situation, we see if ReCode® method resonates with you. You'll leave with clarity, whether you continue or not. I don't 'sell packages'. I seek authentic connections with leaders truly ready to ReCode their BEING, not just 'improve their doing'. If after first session you feel 'this is what I needed', we continue. If not, no problem. You'll still leave with value (deep clarity about yourself)."
