    quote: `Hugooo, When I joined the company, I found a leader who went beyond expectations: someone agile, resilient and deeply inspiring. You were a guide in my first steps, teaching me not only the path, but also the deep meaning of being a true leader.
    I deeply admire your ability to face setbacks, both personal and professional, with courage and humility, transforming them into valuable lessons. You learned to recognize your mistakes, something that not only made you stronger, but also strengthened those of us fortunate enough to work alongside you.
    Your dedication, commitment and passion for inspiring your team are qualities that marked my career and that today, looking back, I am immensely grateful for. You helped me understand that leading is not simply directing, but serving, motivating and building with empathy and conviction.
    I remember you with respect and admiration, because beyond professional achievements, you left a mark on me that transcends the work environment. Thank you for your time, for your teachings and for demonstrating that a leader is not born, but is built with each decision, with each acknowledged mistake and with each person you inspire.
    A warm hug from afar. Meli.`,
